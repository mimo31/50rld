# 50rld
50rld is a tile-based game created as the Final Project for CS50x (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) 2015.

### Gameplay
In the beginning, you find yourself in the middle of a proceduraly generated terrain consisting of five biomes. Forest, plain, lake, desert, and the death biome. You use the arrow keys to move, the plus key to zoom in, the minus key to zoom out, the A key to show the actions of the current tile and the numbers from 1 to 8 to show the actions of the items in your inventory. You can collect some items by going to a tile, pressing A to get the actions shown, selecting an action using the arrow keys and confirming the selection by the Enter key. After you perform such action, some items might get added to the inventory. If your inventory is full and some items are about to be added there, they will be placed on the ground where you can grab them after you clear your inventory a bit. The presence of items on the ground is indicated by a red square in the top left corner of the tile. When you think your inventory is overcrowded, you can drop some of the items by pressing a key with a number between 1 and 8, then selecing the Drop action, entering the number of items to drop after that, and then pressing the Enter key to confirm.

### Current State of Development
There are core systems/algorithms/classes already written. There are ideas for more features to be implmented also, but know one knows if there will be enough time and effort.
